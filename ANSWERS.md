Question: Architecture: If we were to transition this from an in-memory array to a real database (like PostgreSQL or MongoDB), what changes would you make to the EnquiryManager architecture?
ANSWER 1: Currently the system is storing enquiries in a simple in-memory array and once the application is restarted all the data is lost and i usually experience this when i work with SQLite, but in real world production we will use postgress, mongodb or other real database, and to transition well, i would create a file like that is resonsible for saving, retrieving and searching enquiries in the database the goal will trying to avoid direct interaction with the array. also i will make methods async, and add proper error handling for failed database operations
QUESTION 2: Security: What are some potential security risks in the current createEnquiry implementation?
ANSWER 2:measures such as validate all inputs, add rate limit and or possibly add CAPTCHA or implment authentication to prevent abuse and attacks if displayed in the browser.
